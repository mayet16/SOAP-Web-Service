# SOAP-Web-Service
Spring Boot with Oracle Database 
a web service is a machine-to-machine, platform independent service that allows communication over a network.
The contract-first approach requires us to create the domain (methods and parameters) for our service first
I start with the WSDL contract, from which we generate the Java classes.

The SOAP web service endpoint class will handle all the incoming requests for the service
